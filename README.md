# todo-app
Technologies used: MongoDB, ReactJS, NodeJS and ExpressJS.
Worked with vanilla JavaScript and DOM apis to create a Todo App.
Used promises and fetch api to get the data to render on front end.]

# Functionality
Only authenticated users should be able to open the todo list page.
Already registered users should not be allowed to register again.
Dynamic user name should be visible after successful login.
A user should be able to add the todo task (activity).
At a time only one task can be selected, if trying to start another task, then a popup or alert mentioning finishing the ongoing task first or pause the ongoing task should appear.
